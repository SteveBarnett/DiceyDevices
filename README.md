DiceyDevices
============

Dicey Devices was made over one and a half-ish days [as part of a hackathon](http://naga.co.za/2013/11/05/dicey-devices/).

The goal was to remind us:

* about the huge diversity of devices that access the web;
* about how many people are multi-device users;
* the importance of testing on real devices.

It takes six devices and throws randomly on to a 3 x 2 grid, then applies a couple of filters and transformations to them, namely:

* stretching the devices horizontally and / or vertically, by a little or a lot;
* apply a 3d twist to them left or right, by a little or a lot;
* colouring them in;
* by mimicking by bad or old screens by fading, desaturating, blurring, darkening, or showing a crack on the screen.

There's also a super secret "night-mode".
